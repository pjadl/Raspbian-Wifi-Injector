Raspbian-Wifi-Injector
======================

With this portable program, you can do a headless Raspbian setup... by wifi!

That's right, setup your wifi before burning the image to your SD card.  Burn it, plug your SD card into your Raspberry Pi and enjoy instant wireless access.

Now... I'd like to get some things clear:

1) This only works for Wheezy Raspbian (for now).

2) This program is a hack... it gets you into your Raspberry Pi wirelessly... and that's it.  No security settings.

3) You should give me all your love!
