Raspbian-Wifi-Injector
======================

Update:

The suckhole Yank Matthew Bennett, better known as abishru has decided to ban me.  This means I won't be releasing the final program to the public.  It's a pity that shitheads like that stop the advancement of other users, just for a power trip.  But then again, he is American, so it's understood why.

Update:

Due to the ignorance expressed by the moderators of raspberrypi.org, I am pulling this program.  If you have a problem with that, talk with jamesh (moderator).

Welcome to raspberrypi.org, where a moderator can make a comment in a public forum and it is deemed as helpful.  But quote what he says, and it is deemed as rude.

The hypocrites win!  Sorry.

With this portable program, you can do a headless Raspbian setup... by wifi!

That's right, setup your wifi before burning the image to your SD card.  Burn it, plug your SD card into your Raspberry Pi and enjoy instant wireless access.

Now... I'd like to get some things clear:

1) This only works for Wheezy Raspbian (for now).

2) This program is a hack... it gets you into your Raspberry Pi wirelessly... and that's it.  No security settings.

3) You should give me all your love!
